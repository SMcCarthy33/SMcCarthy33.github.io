# Sean McCarthy CS 499 ePortfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science ePortfolio for the CS 499 Capstone. This repository contains my original artifacts, enhanced artifacts, written narratives, professional self assessment, and the link to my code review video. This ePortfolio brings together everything I have learned throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU and showcases my growth as a developer.
