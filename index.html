    <h1>Sean McCarthy CS 499 ePortfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Computer Science ePortfolio for the SNHU Capstone. This site contains my professional self assessment, my enhanced and original project artifacts, my narratives, and my code review video. These items together represent my growth throughout the Computer Science program and demonstrate my skills in software design, algorithms, databases, security, and communication.</p>
